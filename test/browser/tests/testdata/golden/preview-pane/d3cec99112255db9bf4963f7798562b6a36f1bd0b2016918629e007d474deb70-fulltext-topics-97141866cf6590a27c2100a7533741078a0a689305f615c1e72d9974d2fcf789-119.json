Even now, I think, Japanese would regard idiosyncratic handwriting as a sign of rampant, “selfish” individualism in its pejorative sense—unless, of course, calligraphy as an art form is involved. Here, the expression of individuality and personality is entirely appropriate—so appropriate that many Japanese cannot read what is written in this “art form.” The writing done at school is not meant to be like this. For first graders, another daily practice in writing is the preparation of the renrakucho. This is a book in which children write their daily assignments and other information that the teacher wants to reach each home: notes about plans for future projects, equipment, or money required, for instance, or exhortations about getting to school wasuremono nai yo ni, “without any forgotten things.” (I thought this was only our problem for a long time, but I’ve come to think it was a problem in many homes, and not just in first grade.) The teacher’s message amounts to two or three sentences a day copied from the board, where the teacher writes it at a pace a quick student could keep up with. The fact that this information is needed at home means that parents join in the pressure to produce intelligible writing. Parents must stamp the message each day and can use the booklet to send messages back to the teacher. She also stamps it each day to indicate she has seen it. Ellen also brought home many drawings that, like the drawings in the reading text, included writing on the same page. Her writings here were more than just captions, often several sentences, and by the end of her time in Japan, the writing was exclusively in Japanese. (She continued to answer some questions in English in her homework book and other contexts.) In the third term of first grade students were required to make and keep a book of reflections on school life, which they handed in periodically and which the teacher reviewed. Both Sam and Ellen seemed to enjoy writing and the calligraphy classes in school. They seemed especially proud of the writing they did",
