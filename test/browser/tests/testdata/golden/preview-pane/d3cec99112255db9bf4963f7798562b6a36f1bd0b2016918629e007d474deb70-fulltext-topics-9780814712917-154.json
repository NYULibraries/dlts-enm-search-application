I myself could barely produce an intelligible map of how to get to our house from the train station. At some point I began to wonder why everyone in Japan could draw and I couldn’t. Of course, I’d known since about second grade that I wasn’t good at art, and I hadn’t drawn anything since then. I had only vague memories of any art classes in school, though I enjoyed wood carving, weaving, and some other crafts in seventh grade. When I started reading about the Japanese philosophy of education, the “anyone can do anything” school of thought, I wondered how teachers could sustain this attitude in the face of what seemed to me to be overwhelming evidence of natural differences in talents and inclinations, especially in the arts. But not being able to draw bothered me more and more as I reflected on my friends’ competence and comfort in drawing. Surely not all 120 million Japanese could be more talented than I. I finally decided that I would make a private test of the Japanese approach, and I signed up for beginners’ drawing lessons at a local museum. I learned that I could learn to draw. I still think I have no talent, and it would take more than eight Sunday afternoons to become competent, but I’m sure I could do it.
