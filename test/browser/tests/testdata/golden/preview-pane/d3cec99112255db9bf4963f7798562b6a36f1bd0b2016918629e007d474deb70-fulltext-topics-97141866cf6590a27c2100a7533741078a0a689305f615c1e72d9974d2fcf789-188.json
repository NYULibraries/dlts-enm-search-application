    "pageText": "even more when the announcement at every train station in Japan seems to be saying “Let’s check carefully and not leave any forgotten belongings.” Who are they kidding?) It is not just in awarding themselves stars on charts that children are involved in self-evaluation. Hansei (self-evaluation, reflection), is an activity that applies to many different kinds of actions. This is what classes do when they review their class trip or their preparations for Sports Day, or after reading a story or completing a lesson in social studies or mathematics. As a literary form hansei are intended to embrace both emotional reactions and intellectual understandings, which are not nearly so separated as they tend to be in Western literary forms. In the third term of first grade, Ellen and her classmates began keeping a formal hansei notebook containing reflections about school. Ellen’s first entries noted what she liked about school and what she found “troublesome.” I like to read. I like Japanese. I like recess and other things. I like phys ed and art. I like cleaning. I like to be class leader. I like my friends. I don’t like lunch. I don’t like to carry a heavy backpack. I don’t like to walk to school. This notebook was handed in to the teacher, who responded to Ellen with “You like a lot of things. I’m relieved. As for the troublesome things, what can make them better? If you think good thoughts, maybe they’ll get better.” Later entries still had lunch as a troublesome thing, but by the end she had stopped mentioning it, whereas the list of things she liked had expanded to include the teacher, the backpack, and school in general. The teacher’s last comment in reply dealt mostly with a bad spelling mistake Ellen repeated several times. It is not difficult to see some mental coercion here.",
