While the mother-daughter bond should be the tightest of all, wrote Gabrielle Jackson in 1905, it could misfire—and if it did, “it is … mother’s fault.” A basic need was for mothers not only to keep pace with their daughters’ interests but also to relax control and emotional demands in order to grant independence.
